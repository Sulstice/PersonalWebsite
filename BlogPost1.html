    <h1>Till Career or Death do us Part.</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Twice in my life I come across two chances of choosing either career or love.<br><br>
        The first instance was when I got accepted into graduate school two states away from my ex-fiancé. The second is leaving graduate school and switching on to another program. Despite the emotional situations in between both two scenarios the underlying internal question was do I choose career or love?
        In the first scenario, I had to pick whether I should wait a year for my ex-fiancé to complete her undergraduate education and potentially embark to graduate school together or start my graduate education in hopes that we will eventually figure it out.

        <br><br>Naturally, as a young individual, the advice I received from both my friends and family was to go pursue my dreams regardless of the relationship at hand. Selfishly, I left but kept the relationship long distance. Within ten months the long distance only served as a catalyst for the inevitable and the relationship dissolved. It happens and we move on.
        Fast forward a couple of months and I face myself enclosed in the same scenario. A love that has emerging between two best friends but here I am leaving again to go pursue another step in my journey. The question must be asked do I stay or should I go? Do I miss my chance of finding the far-fetched, romantic dream of “The One”? A platitudinous question that somehow still governs our emotions.

    <h2>The Love Conundrum</h2>

    <p>“There are plenty of fish in the sea” is a provocative statement that haunts me the most. The earthquake that shatters every bedrock foundation of relationships.
        A statement that is repeated by my friend’s countless times any time we enter a break-up period that even though feels hackneyed still holds some weight and is infinitely easier to accept.
        Considering this I ask myself the big question “What if”. What if she is “The One”? My mom’s voices always reverberate into my ears after her failed marriage “Marry your best friend”.
        If I follow my mother’s advice it’s just semantics and I should marry her now. But question still lingers in the base of my cranium and feels more poignant as the days progress.<br> <br>
        We tease each other by talking about the future. We try to grasp our feelings at hand and answer the question of “What if” by giving us a small glimpse through a window of our possible life together. Will we retire to that quite cabin in the woods raising chickens and cows until we pass of old age? How would our kids look like and what could we call them (my personal favourites Qasar and Zenith)?. What beliefs would we raise our kids on and do we agree on our core values? We test each other to make sure we are on the same page, we are looking for an excuse to break our relationship so that the “What if” question is answered.
        And so far, we haven't found one.

    <h2>The Career Conundrum</h2>

    <p>As I set the trail of my future career by taking a very non-conventional path but shifting my way through the perplexities of an unknown field.
        The problem with diving into the unknown is that it is unknown. I chose that I am don’t want to be complacent in life, a human being that exists and only wastes resources.
        As I go by my undergraduate university’s motto “What starts here changes the world.”, no matter how cliché those words are, they still are imprinted in my memory.
        It serves as a motivator to push forward.
        <br><br>The question remains, if I am constantly striving for more will I always have to put my career as a priority over love? When will it stop or if it ever will?</p>


    <h2>Till career or death do us part?</h2>

    <p>Lost in the sea of emotions with no land in sight. My mother declared “If you love her, and if it was meant to be, it will work itself out and last forever.”.
        A simple but powerful statement that echoed against my ear drums and silenced the whispers of “What if”.<br><br>
        In the end, I assuaged these feelings of anxiety of the future and only embracing the present.
        If she is meant to be my paramour then regardless of where my career might take me or hers, then the love will wait until the moment is right and we can settle down.<br><br>
        I’ll let you know how it goes.
