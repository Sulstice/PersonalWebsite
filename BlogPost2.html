    <h1>Teaching Organic Chemistry Part 1</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Teaching is a complex, multifaceted activity that, over time, I have become to master. During my undergraduate and graduate university days I taught  16 sections of organic chemistry which equates to about 320 students! From which I have only been offered one marriage proposal (my response is still pending).
        Over the course of my teaching career so far, through trial and error, I have come to really notice what methods of teaching works and what doesn't, how professional are you supposed to be, and having fun!<br><br> So sit back and read into the basics of teaching organic chemistry.

    </p>
    <h2>Cranking out the names</h2>

    <p>So in my sections I make it an imperative point memorizing my students names, which I know seems a little basic but a common fact overlooked. I know what you are thinking, there are 80 names on this list! Trust me it is worth it, and over time and constant repetition it becomes a lot easier.  From what I have noticed is a sense of connection between student and teacher, it shows them a very basic level of respect.
        It shows that you have cared about them at least to memorize their names (they also bother to learn yours). Just getting over that little hurdle really helps in a more awesome experience for both parties.

    <h2>Knowledge can come from anyone</h2>

    <p>There seems to be a stigma in the graduate student world where they must always know more than the undergraduate student. Kind of an egocentric mentality which is fine because academia is a very competitive and encourages this sort of behavior. But what lacks is a since of open-mindedness to new information
    or information that you thought was right which turned out to be wrong.<br>
    In my undergraduate student days, during my biochemistry class, there was an assignment to read this paper on global warming and how we can use insects as a definitive measure of climate change <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/18/6668.full">(Here's the paper)</a>. After reading it and taking notes, the teaching assistant asked me do you believe what the authors are saying is true?
    I had to think for a moment, do I believe these authors who I have never met just because they are published I assume they are correct. She challenged me into questioning more published science, but this also translates to professors and teaching assistants as well. When I first got challenged on a mechanism I was teaching by one of my students, I realized I totally fucked this up. He questioned, not my ability as a qualified instructor, but just the idea at hand.
    It was from that first challenged moment I set any ego I had aside and listened as he explained the answer to me. It didn't take away from my credibility but encouraged the students to start challenging previous ideas and encouraging to contrive their own.
        With students it can be a give and take, a bounce of ideas, a refreshing blend of new information. Sometimes as instructors we adopt tunnel vision and the view becomes parochial.
        This becomes necessary so that I will learn in as well. Asking students to question things I will teach them makes them also think about the problem and whether they accept it. A lot of science is full of arguments and beliefs, students who only memorize facts lose the ability to think and form their own views. They also became more comfortable in sharing their ideas and sometimes the lecture would turn into a tantalizing discussion.

    <h2>Be Passionate</h2>

    <p>I love organic chemistry, it is undeniably fun and I am incredibly passionate about the subject. I love teaching it to the world and having students also figuring out how it is used, and why it isn't just a class but real life.
        Students love to see passion in their life, if it doesn't come from them but if you show you are interested in the subject they will start vicarously live through you. In my early college days of drinking cheap expired beer, my professor started explaining the concept of maxwell relations. As she delved deeper into the math and how extrodinary the derivatives of the equations and the knowledge you can produce (you can quantify entropy!!!) she started to cry.
        The beauty of the math was so amazing to her that she couldn't comprehend how such a beautiful concept was extant. Through her I fell in love with the relation equations and really dedicated some time to learning it striving to get a glimpse of what she sees.
    </p>

    <h2>Have fun!</h2>

    <p>
        Remember to have fun! I want students to be engaged with each other, talk to each other, and also play around with the chemistry. Science and engineering is built on ideas and being creative. When students feel pressured to do the work it loses a sense of creativity and also discourages them from actively learning the subject (perhaps pushing them to plagarism).
        Also it makes it fun for you, the instructor, where it doesn't have to be just a job or a requirement but a much more meaningful and enriching experience!
