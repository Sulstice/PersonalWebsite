    <h1>Graduate School Application</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Getting into graduate school was tough. In the first time I applied, the most difficult part of the application I came
        across was the <b>Statement of Purpose</b>. What was I planning to embark on in life and will this graduate school
        I so carefully picked out going to get me there.

        <br>
        <br>

        Instead of go through my life long journey, I figured I would show you guys the SOP I wrote that where I was
        accepted. Hopefully, it can help some of y'all (I had to use it) out there as an example into what really goes into
        making this document. So without further ado I present my unedited SOP from 2016.

    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 30%;"> Statement of Purpose</h2>

    <p id = "statementOfPurposeText" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-style: italic">
        My research journey began as a sophomore in a neuroscience group that aimed to
        predict seizure onset on tonic-clonic epilespsy by inhibiting nuclei in the insular cortex region of
        the brain. Our group was able to determine seizure onset by measuring the increase in
        frequency on interictal EEGs three seconds before it occurred. The experience taught me on
        how to establish a research proposal, how to design experiments and properly analyze data.

        My enthusiasm for chemistry and medicine began as I started reading material on natural
        product research, specifically the creativity needed for synthesis. At a seminar, Dr. Jeremy May
        from the University of Houston presented some of his work on anti-malarial agents. His
        research was extremely exciting, and I was fortunate to gain a summer REU in his lab. My
        project was on bis-indole alkaloid modifications to help improve anti-malarial binding
        efficiency. During this time, I was able to successfully develop a nine-step synthesis routes of
        natural product derivatives that improved the biological activity of potential new therapeutics.
        My work was presented at the Intellectual Entrepreneurship Citizen Scholars and Research
        Bazaar at U.T Austin and published in the undergraduate research journal.

        <br>

        A difficult challenge during one of my synthesis routes was a selective deprotection of
        an acetamide placed on an indole. A literature search resulted in the discovery of a reaction
        from the early 1900’s that discussed the idea of hydrazine being able to selectively cleave an
        acetal to produce a free amine. Since there was no experimental procedure in the paper, I had
        to improvise this on my own. To my surprise after four days the reaction was successful and the
        last step of my synthesis was complete. I thoroughly enjoyed the internship, it helped show me
        that I could be successful in the field as well as giving me the strong desire to pursue it further.

        <br>
        <br>

        After graduating, I was offered a summer internship at M.D Anderson Cancer Center at
        the Insitute of Applied Cancer Science (IACS) under Dr. Palmer. My project was to modify an
        isoxazole-benzimidazole scaffold to fit inside the pocket of a bromodomain site used to
        enhance binding affinity and liver clearance. Over the course of the summer internship, I
        successfully synthesized 60 new small molecules with one showing promise. The molecule is
        able to selectively target the specific site with a potent binding affinity that turned off DNA
        transcription in breast cancer cells and improved liver clearance. My research was presented to
        the entire board of IACS with a publication and a patent currently being developed.

        <br>
        <br>

        Currently, I am working as a TA for the University of Texas at Austin as well as working in
        Dr. Humphrey’s lab dealing with organometallic reactions and inorganic synthesis. I was
        introduced to this area while taking Advanced Organometallics during my senior year. The
        project I was given deals with asymmetric biphenyl phosphine ligands for expansion of metal
        organic frameworks pores. So far, I have successfully created a meta dicarboxynl biphenyl
        compound that coordinates to cobalt and magnesium to produce an open pore framework.
        Since I have also been taking computer science courses while working in Dr. Humphrey’s lab, I
        initiated an independent project to look at selective screening of organic molecules into a
        coordination polymer. The project is co-advised by Dr. Humphrey and collaboration with
        Schrodinger and Texas Advanced Computing Center. So far, I been able to predict molecule
        insertion and packing inside a magnesium copper pore and the research is scheduled to be
        presented at the upcoming ACS Computers in Chemistry conference in San Diego.

        <br>
        <br>

        All of the above experiences have led me to work in the field of bio-organometallic
        chemistry, and most importantly, work at the University of Michigan. I believe that this new
        field can help develop new therapeutic and imaging agents. I am confident in my abilities and
        would be happy to work in a number of labs; namely Dr. Lehnert or Dr. Sun. I feel that Dr.
        Lehnert’s research on B12 and metalloporphyrin synthesis and Dr. Sun’s work on PRC2
        complexes for epigenetic histone modifications fit well with my experiences and interests. With
        the right computational aspects on protein-ligand binding I can also see myself excelling with
        Dr. Fierke on her work with metalloenzymes in the HDAC and how they influence gene
        expression. If I am accepted to University of Michigan graduate program, I will work diligently,
        and I know that I can contribute to the research of several of the labs.

        Through my consistent record of advanced, even graduate, classes as an undergraduate
        at UT, I proved how capable I am of learning and performing at the graduate level. Through my
        experience in research, I gained experience on how to employ my knowledge and apply it
        strategically to complex problems in chemistry. Being a teaching assistant for general chemistry
        and organic chemistry lab has led me to be capable of conveying information in a clear and
        concise manner, a critical skill for the program. I have also been awarded Teaching Assistant of
        the year because of my ability to effectively teach and motivate undergraduates. Research has
        given me a purpose it has also demonstrated my work ethic, determination, or more
        importantly, passion. I can attest to myself holding these values and I hope to turn my burning
        enthusiasm into reality and prove myself by facilitating the advancement of this institution and
        chemistry both present and future.

    <p> I hope this piece was valuable, feel free to branch off of this document as a starting template for your own SOP
        (if you liked it!)

        <br>

        Until then I wish you guys luck and feel free to contact me if you have any other questions!
